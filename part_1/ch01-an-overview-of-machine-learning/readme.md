# 1.1 Introduction

Machine learning is a field in computer science where existing data are used to predict, or respond to, future data. /it is closely related to the fields of pattern recognition, computational statics, and artificial intelligence. Machine learning is important in areas like facial recognition, spam filtering, and others where it is not feasible, or even possible, to write algorithms to perform a task.

## 1.5.2 neural nets
A neural net is a network designed to emulate the neurons in a human brain. Each "neuron" has a mathematical model for determining its output from its input; for example, if the output is a step function with a value of 0 or 1, the neuron can be "firing" if the input stimulus results in a 1 output. Networks are then formed with multiple layers of interconnected neurons. Neural networks are a form of pattern recognition. The network must be trained using sample data, but no a priori model is required. Networks can be trained to estimate the output of nonlinear processes and network then becomes the model.
